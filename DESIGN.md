# SphericalTokenizer Design Document

## Overview

SphericalTokenizer is a security-focused tokenization system that provides RBAC-secured transformations for embedding vectors. It uses a novel approach combining spherical geometry and particle momentum simulation to create secure, reversible transformations that are resistant to various attacks.

## Core Components

### 1. CrossModalManager

The central component that orchestrates secure transformations across different modalities:
- Manages modality-specific configurations
- Handles device movement (CPU/GPU)
- Provides anomaly detection
- Ensures cross-modal consistency

### 2. Momentum-Based Encryption

Uses particle momentum simulation for secure transformations:
- Deterministic transformations based on cryptographic keys
- Reversible operations for encryption/decryption
- Scale-invariant transformations using relative metrics
- Guaranteed minimum transformation effect

### 3. Spheroid Decomposition

Decomposes n-dimensional space into overlapping spheroids:
- Each spheroid defines a local transformation region
- Smooth transitions between regions
- Configurable containment thresholds
- Device-independent operations

## Security Features

### 1. Validation Checks

Multiple layers of validation ensure embedding integrity:
- Value range checks (-100 to 100)
- Magnitude validation (1e-8 to 1e4)
- NaN/Inf detection
- Entropy-based anomaly detection

### 2. Consistency Verification

Robust consistency checks for transformations:
- Reconstruction error validation (relative tolerance)
- Transformation effect verification (20% minimum change)
- Deterministic transformation validation
- Cross-modal consistency checks

### 3. Anomaly Detection

Multi-factor anomaly detection system:
- Entropy-based analysis
- Transformation consistency checks
- Value range validation
- Combined scoring with reduced sensitivity

## Implementation Details

### 1. Device Handling

Robust device management for GPU acceleration:
- Automatic device detection
- Consistent device state
- Efficient cache management
- Safe device transitions

### 2. Numerical Stability

Careful handling of numerical operations:
- Relative error metrics
- Minimum value clamping
- Stable normalization
- Configurable tolerances

### 3. Performance Optimization

Performance considerations:
- Caching of derived values
- Batch processing support
- Efficient tensor operations
- Memory-conscious design

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Initialization

```python
manager = CrossModalManager(
    modalities={'image': 512, 'text': 768},
    master_key=b'your-secret-key'
)
```

### 2. Transformation

```python
transformed = manager.secure_cross_modal_transform({
    'image': image_embedding,
    'text': text_embedding
})
```

### 3. Validation

```python
anomalies = manager.detect_anomalies(embeddings)
is_consistent = manager.verify_cross_modal_consistency(embeddings)
```

## Security Considerations

1. The system provides security through:
   - Cryptographic key derivation
   - Multi-factor validation
   - Transformation irreversibility
   - Anomaly detection

2. Protected against:
   - Jailbreak attempts
   - Embedding manipulation
   - Cross-modal attacks
   - Numerical exploits

3. Limitations:
   - Requires secure key management
   - Performance overhead from validation
   - Memory requirements for caching
   - GPU dependency for optimal performance
