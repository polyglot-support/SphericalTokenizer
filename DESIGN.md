# SphericalTokenizer Design Document

## Overview
SphericalTokenizer is a GPU-accelerated cryptographic system designed to secure embedding vectors used in Large Language Models (LLMs) through geometric transformations and controlled randomization. The system provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) capabilities by layering encrypted embeddings, effectively preventing unauthorized access patterns including jailbreaks and prompt injection attacks.

## Core Concepts

### Spherical Decomposition
The system decomposes n-dimensional embedding spaces into n/3 spheroids. Each spheroid represents a subspace of the original embedding, allowing for:
- Geometric isolation of semantic components
- Independent encryption of subspaces
- Preservation of relative distances within subspaces
- GPU-accelerated parallel processing of spheroids

### Particle Momentum Encryption
At the center of each spheroid, a virtual particle is placed whose momentum is determined by a cryptographically secure PRNG. This provides:
- Deterministic but secure transformation of vectors
- Preservation of semantic relationships while obscuring raw values
- Reversible encryption through inverse momentum application
- Batch processing capabilities for efficient GPU utilization

### Layered RBAC
The system implements security through sequential layering of encrypted embeddings:
1. Base Layer: Core embedding vectors
2. Role Layers: Role-specific transformations
3. Access Layers: Context-dependent restrictions

## Mathematical Foundation

### Spheroid Generation
For an n-dimensional embedding space E, we generate n/3 spheroids S_i where:
- Each S_i is defined by center c_i and radius r_i
- Spheroids are positioned to maximize coverage while minimizing overlap
- Dimension reduction preserves semantic clustering
- GPU-optimized matrix operations for efficient computation

### Momentum Application
For each spheroid S_i:
1. Generate seed k_i from master key K
2. Initialize PRNG with k_i
3. Generate momentum vector m_i
4. Transform vectors within S_i according to m_i
5. Utilize GPU parallelization for batch processing

### Layer Composition
Layers L_j are composed through:
1. Sequential application of transformations T_j
2. Preservation of inverse transformations T_j^(-1)
3. Validation of composition properties
4. Efficient GPU-based batch operations

## Performance Characteristics

encrypted = tokenizer.encrypt(embedding)
decrypted = tokenizer.decrypt(encrypted)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple vectors efficiently on GPU
batch = torch.randn(32, 768)  # Optimal batch size
encrypted_batch = tokenizer.transform_batch(batch)
decrypted_batch = tokenizer.transform_batch(encrypted_batch, decrypt=True)
```

### RBAC Implementation
```python
# Define roles with GPU-accelerated transformations
admin_layer = tokenizer.create_role("admin", {"read", "write"})
user_layer = tokenizer.create_role("user", {"read"})

# Apply role-based encryption
admin_view = tokenizer.apply_layer(encrypted, "admin")
user_view = tokenizer.apply_layer(encrypted, "user")
```
