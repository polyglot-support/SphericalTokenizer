# SphericalTokenizer Design Document

## Overview

SphericalTokenizer is a security-focused tokenization system that provides RBAC-secured transformations for embedding vectors. It uses a novel approach combining spherical geometry and particle momentum simulation to create secure, reversible transformations that are resistant to various attacks.

## Core Components

### 1. CrossModalManager

The central component that orchestrates secure transformations across different modalities:
- Manages modality-specific configurations
- Handles device movement (CPU/GPU)
- Provides anomaly detection
- Ensures cross-modal consistency
- Supports configurable complexity levels

### 2. Momentum-Based Encryption

Uses particle momentum simulation for secure transformations with configurable complexity:

#### Complexity Levels

1. **Minimal**
   - Simple static shift using momentum vector
   - Fixed small shift magnitude (0.1)
   - No rotation or scaling
   - Fastest performance
   - Suitable for basic context differentiation

2. **Basic**
   - Basic rotation and scaling
   - Fixed scaling factor (1.2)
   - Simple momentum-based shift
   - Good performance
   - Suitable for low-security applications

3. **Standard**
   - Full momentum-based transformation
   - Multiple spheroid regions
   - Complete rotation and scaling
   - Balanced performance
   - Suitable for most security needs

4. **High**
   - Enhanced security features
   - Double the number of spheroids
   - More complex transformations
   - Higher computational cost
   - Maximum protection level

### 3. Spheroid Decomposition

Decomposes n-dimensional space into overlapping spheroids:
- Number of spheroids varies by complexity level
- Each spheroid defines a local transformation region
- Smooth transitions between regions
- Configurable containment thresholds
- Device-independent operations

## Security Features

### 1. Validation Checks

Multiple layers of validation ensure embedding integrity:
- Value range checks (-100 to 100)
- Magnitude validation (1e-8 to 1e4)
- NaN/Inf detection
- Entropy-based anomaly detection

### 2. Consistency Verification

Robust consistency checks for transformations:
- Reconstruction error validation (relative tolerance)
- Transformation effect verification (20% minimum change)
- Deterministic transformation validation
- Cross-modal consistency checks

### 3. Anomaly Detection

Multi-factor anomaly detection system:
- Entropy-based analysis
- Transformation consistency checks
- Value range validation
- Combined scoring with reduced sensitivity

## Implementation Details

### 1. Device Handling

Robust device management for GPU acceleration:
- Automatic device detection
- Consistent device state
- Efficient cache management
- Safe device transitions

### 2. Numerical Stability

Careful handling of numerical operations:
- Relative error metrics
- Minimum value clamping
- Stable normalization
- Configurable tolerances

### 3. Performance Optimization

Performance considerations:
- Complexity level selection
- Caching of derived values
- Batch processing support
- Efficient tensor operations
- Memory-conscious design

## Complexity Level Implementation

### 1. Minimal Complexity

```python
# Simple static shift
momentum = self._get_cached_momentum(0, embedding.shape[-1])
transformed = embedding + momentum * 0.1
```

### 2. Basic Complexity

```python
# Basic rotation and scaling
momentum = self._get_cached_momentum(0, embedding.shape[-1])
scale = 1.2
transformed = scale * (embedding + momentum * 0.2)
```

### 3. Standard Complexity

```python
# Full momentum-based transformation
transformed = self.encryptors[modality].encrypt_vector(
    embedding,
    config.spheroids
)
```

### 4. High Complexity

```python
# Enhanced security with double spheroids
spheroids = generator.generate_spheroids() * 2
transformed = self.encryptors[modality].encrypt_vector(
    embedding,
    spheroids
)
```

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Choosing Complexity Levels

- **Minimal**: Use for simple context differentiation where security is not critical
- **Basic**: Use for low-security applications with good performance requirements
- **Standard**: Default choice for most applications
- **High**: Use when maximum security is required

### 2. Performance Considerations

Each complexity level has different performance characteristics:
- Minimal: O(n) operations
- Basic: O(n) operations with constant overhead
- Standard: O(n * s) operations where s is number of spheroids
- High: O(n * 2s) operations with double spheroids

### 3. Security Implications

Security strength increases with complexity:
- Minimal: Basic context separation only
- Basic: Simple transformation security
- Standard: Full cryptographic security
- High: Enhanced cryptographic security
